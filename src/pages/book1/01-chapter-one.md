"Greg?"

"Yes?" Greg closed his chat and looked up at the intern.

"Um, did you try to use the app yet?"

"What app?"

"The one for crossing the line?"

"Um, not yet, still thinking about it," said Greg.  "Why, is it not working?"  He found Tyler’s email and clicked on the link.  There was a pleasingly modern styled graphic of an orange line slashed across the browser page, with a little circle on the left side containing a small photograph of Greg.

"Oh, you didn’t have to log in?"

"I think I was already logged in?" said Greg, not entirely sure.

"Me too," said the intern, holding up his phone, "but it’s asking me to log in again."

"It might be different on mobile," said Greg, peering at the phone screen.

"Hey, guys," said Marian, leaning over Greg’s cubicle wall, "did you try to use the app yet?"

"Are you using it on mobile?" asked the intern excitedly, only to deflate as she said, "No."

"I’m on Windows though?" said Marian.

"It works in Chrome on Mac," said Greg, indicating his screen with a shrug.

"Is it asking you to log in?" tried the intern again.

"No, that part is fine," said Marian, deflating the intern again.  "But once I’m in I can’t interact with the circle.  That I’m supposed to drag over the line.  It just… nothing happens."

"Hey," said one of the Jeffs, Greg was never sure which, skating down the row.  "Have you guys tried using the app?"

"It works for me," said Greg while Marian and the intern said, "It’s not working for me."

"It worked okay, I think," said Jeff, "but it closed right after I dragged it across the line so I’m not sure if it saved?  I didn’t get a confirmation email or anything."

"Oh!" said Greg, almost in relief.  "Tyler just sent another email."  He clicked to open it.  The intern picked up his phone.  Marian opened the laptop she was carrying.  Jeff peeked over at it.
