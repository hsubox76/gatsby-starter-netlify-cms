Howdy fellow Scamps!

If you know me, you know I don’t like dancing around the point so I’ll cut straight to it.  Starting today, Scampyre is going to make a massive pivot.  We’ve drifted away from our core business over the years, experimenting with projects the press has derided as “Tinder for timber” and “Uber for hats.”  We have an amazing team here and I’ve come to realize all this talent is wasted when spread so thin.  Time and time again, I’ve seen us work best when focused together as one on a single goal, such as that month we pulled everyone off other projects to work on the moon cannon.  The results speak for themselves.  Every man, woman, and child on the planet can see that hole in the moon.

This time I’m shooting not for a tangible celestial object but for a goal much closer to my own heart.  I’ve watched as politics has become ever more fractured in this country and our society is tearing apart at the seams.  The same people propose the same solutions over and over again and things only get worse.  The nation - no the world - needs someone who has the courage to break the cycle and do what needs to be done.

That’s why I mean to eat the Constitution.

This will be controversial.  I’ve always prided myself in fostering ideological diversity at Scampyre, resulting in a kaleidoscope of different political views among us, ranging from Republican to Democrat.  Some of us interpret the Constitution one way; some feel it should not be eaten.  I respect everyone’s opinion.  But I still mean to eat that document, and in so doing, evolve into a new and superior form of life, the perfect fusion of man and governing philosophy, a demigod whose very fibers of being extend forth from the founding principles of this country.  In essence, I will become America.

I’m drawing a line on the ground.  Crossing this line means you pledge to join me in this audacious, world-changing, rule-breaking adventure.  Once you cross, there’s no turning back.  There will be dangers, setbacks, and attacks from all sides.  The public won’t understand what we’re doing.  The government, the media, the powers that be, the Smithsonian guards, will fight with all their might to keep things as they are.  If any of that’s going to stop you, don’t cross that line.

And if you want to play it safe?  Anyone who doesn’t want to cross that line with me is free to leave, with a generous severance package and the highest of recommendations for the next step in your journey.

But for those with the vision and the guts to commit, we’re going to be the ones who put that Constitution in my stomach... and the world will never be the same again.

Check the “decline to cross” box if you do not wish to cross the line.)

Let’s do this!

Fondly,
Tyler
