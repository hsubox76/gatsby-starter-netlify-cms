It’s come to my attention that the line crossing app might not be working for a few folks.  Here’s the workaround we’ve come up with:

Everyone at HQ who is having trouble with the app, please report to the main cafeteria.  We’ll have a line on the ground you can cross.
Any remote team members or anyone who can’t make it to the cafeteria, send Kathleen an email and we’ll do our best to work something out.

Best,
Tyler
