I recently made an unexpectedly popular tweet based on the incredibly deep insight of "what if you removed a letter from a popular library?"  Specifically, what if instead of **prettier** it was **pettier**?  Hahaha!  Instead of cleaning up your code, it would belittle it, you see.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">has anyone made a JS formatter called pettier that doesn&#39;t fix any code but just leaves snarky comments like &quot;// 4 nested callbacks, really?&quot; or &quot;// wow just putting it right in the global namespace huh&quot;</p>&mdash; Christina Holland (@americanwombat) <a href="https://twitter.com/americanwombat/status/1086045699437846528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 17, 2019</a></blockquote>

Anyway instead of getting the (at most) 5 seconds of laughs it deserved before going to the lazy joke graveyard, people really seemed to dig it.
